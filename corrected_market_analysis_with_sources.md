## 2. Technology and Budget Data (Limited Sources)

### 2.1 National Library Budget Example

**Technology Spending (Source: National Library of Australia Portfolio Budget 2025-26):**
- **NLA Annual Budget:** $100.1M (2025-26)
- **Technology/Infrastructure components** included but not itemized for public libraries
- **Source:** library.gov.au Portfolio Budget Statements

**Note:** This is the National Library, not public libraries. Public library budget data requires direct research from councils and library organizations.

## 3. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS (Requiring Validation)

### 3.1 Market Size Estimates ⚠️ UNVERIFIED

**ASSUMPTION: Library Technology Spending**
- Estimated average library IT budget: $6,750-9,000 annually
- **Basis:** Extrapolated from large library budgets, requires survey validation
- **Confidence Level:** Low - needs primary research

**ASSUMPTION: Language Barrier Challenges**
- Estimated daily language barrier incidents per library
- **Basis:** Logical inference from demographics, no verified data
- **Confidence Level:** Very Low - requires library staff surveys

### 3.2 Market Opportunity Projections ⚠️ UNVERIFIED

**ASSUMPTION: Revenue Potential**
- Projected $2.25M ARR potential
- **Basis:** Estimated pricing × assumed adoption rates
- **Confidence Level:** Low - dependent on unverified assumptions

---

## 4. Data Gaps Requiring Primary Research

### 4.1 Critical Missing Data

**Library Operations:**
- ❌ Actual frequency of language barrier incidents
- ❌ Current solutions and their effectiveness  
- ❌ Staff satisfaction with existing tools
- ❌ Actual technology budgets by library size
- ❌ Decision-making processes and timelines

**Community Impact:**
- ❌ Patron experiences with language barriers
- ❌ Multicultural community library usage patterns
- ❌ Current service gaps and unmet needs

**Financial:**

1. **Library Staff Surveys** - 50+ libraries across states
2. **Multicultural Community Interviews** - 100+ diverse patrons
3. **Library Director Interviews** - 20+ decision-makers
4. **Budget Analysis** - Access to actual council library budgets
5. **Competitive Analysis** - Current solution usage and satisfaction

**Secondary Research Needed:**
1. **ALIA Research Reports** - Professional library association studies
2. **Council Diversity Reports** - Local government multicultural strategies
3. **Academic Studies** - Research on multicultural library services
4. **International Comparisons** - Similar markets (Canada, UK, NZ)
