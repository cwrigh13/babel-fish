## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Issues: None identified

### Medium Risk Issues:
1. **Data Staleness**: Some operating hours may become outdated
2. **Website Validity**: Some facility websites may change
3. **Contact Changes**: Phone numbers and email addresses may change

### Low Risk Issues:
1. **Minor formatting inconsistencies** in operating hours
2. **Missing optional fields** (some websites, capacity data)
3. **Coordinate precision** varies slightly between datasets

### Mitigation Strategies:
- **Automated validation**: Implement regular URL and phone validation
- **Update scheduling**: Plan quarterly data refreshes
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Provide alternative contact methods when primary fails
- **User feedback**: Allow community members to report outdated information
